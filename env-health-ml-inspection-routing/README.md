# 🧹 Environmental Health ML – Camden County Inspection Routing

This project uses simulated data from Camden County, NJ to analyze restaurant inspections. It applies ML-based risk scoring and geographic clustering to identify high-priority zones for environmental health interventions.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This dataset is fully synthetic and does **not** contain any real public health inspection data. It is intended for modeling and educational demonstration only.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Labels establishments as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** risk
- Visualizes risk hot spots on an interactive map
- Uses **KMeans clustering** to group inspection zones
- Provides a baseline for route optimization and surveillance planning

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/inspection_routing_camden.ipynb
```

---

## 📊 Features

- Folium map of high-risk inspection sites
- Interactive popups with establishment metadata
- Clustering map using longitude + latitude
